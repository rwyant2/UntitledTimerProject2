# UntitledTimerProject2

31May2017 RLW:
This is a simple timer. I use the timers to play the Five Minute Game. If I can't concentrate, I goof of for 5 minutes. 
Then work for 5 minutes. Then goof off for 5 minutes. Then work for 6 minutes. I keep going back and forth until I get engaged
and forget about goofing off.

I could easily download a timer, but chose to write this for the following reasons:

* I do not want to download a timer that installs the Yahoo Toolbar.
* This gives me a chance to teach myself IntelliJ outside of my current contract.
* I do not want the Yahoo Toolbar.
* It gives me a chance to teach myself multithreaded applications for features I plan to add.
* I'm sure the Yahoo Toolbar is a fine addition for some users, it's just not for me. Thank you, but no.
* I can use this as a chance to automate testing of this app and play with tools like Gauge.
* I do not want the Yahoo Toolber, Ask Jeeves Toolbar, or McAfee Anti-Virus. I am fine. Thank you. Please stop.
* I can show potential clients and employers that while I'm not a Java god, I can do some coding.
* No! I do not want any toolbars! John McAffee cannot use my apartment as a safe house!
* I'd like to turn this into a mobile app and get experience developing/testing there.
* I am not equipped to ward off the Belizian Police. My apartment is not in the best neighborhood anyway.
* For the love of God, STOP WITH THE TOOLBARS! WAT IS JOHN MCAFFEE DOING PLAYING MY CHARACTER ON FALLOUT 4?
* YOU DISMANTLED MY SHOPPING CENTER IN SANCTUARY HILLS! I WAS PULLING DOWN SOME NICE CAPS WITH THAT, YOU JERK!!!

So far, all it can do is count down seconds and stop. I'll update this when a new feature is added or a new testing
tool is introduced.
